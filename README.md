# Project Overview

In this project, we created visualizations using Tableau and created a story to convince investors that a bike-sharing program in Des Moines is a solid business proposal. We created an in-depth, step-by-step analysis of the bike trip data. 

## Results 

Here are the 5 visualizations we created:

### Checkout Times for Users 

The highest duration by hour that bikes are checked out from is between 4-6 hours.

### Checkout Times by Gender

Here, we can see that bikes are mostly checked out by males

The popular times of weekday rides are from 7am-7pm indicated by the darker parts of our heatmap.

### User Trips by Gender

This highlights pretty much the same information as the other two visualizations above, but we can see the user-type is mostly subscribers.

## August Bike Ride Data

August tends to be the busiest month out of the year for bike rides in NYC. Below is a visualization of bike ride data from August 2019 and we can see Manhattan had the most rides conducted by male bike riders. The number of rides total for the month of August itself was over 2.3 million with ~1.6 million being male!

## Summary 

We can conclude that Citi Bike services is used as a popular alternative for commuters during the hottest month of the year, August. Given the data above, we can let our investors know that bike-sharing services is a great public transportation alternative and would be applicable to all genders, but more with males. 

Additional analysis we can include to strengthen our proposal: 

- adding weather trends to visually see the corerlation between number of rides vs weather 
- including data for multiple different months rather than just the summer months
